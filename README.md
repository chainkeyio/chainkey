# ChainKey
ChainKey is a Proof Of Record blockchain. Users upload images and other file formats to a blockchain of their choice such as Ethereum or the Grandeo Hyperledger blockchain or other private or permissioned blockchain.

Use Cases include wills, insurance contents, bills of lading, art provenance, bonded wine proof, music scripts, fashion proofs, academic briefs and so on.

Initially the ChainKey dapp will push the processing to the blockchain at server level. However the javascript hashing will be at the client level in due course so no servers are involved and the push and pulls will be directly to the blockchains.

Toolset includes Hyperledger / Cello / Go / JS and IBM Cloud
